freeathinking,I’ve been a noticer for longer than some of these 20 year olds have been alive so let me try and explain to you what’s happening in holland right now.  You see for as long as I can remember the media here in the US has always reported on Israel/Palestine in the following way…  “Hamas/Palestinian militants stabbed 2 Israelis today in Jerusalem”   Or some twist on that basic premise.  What the media never tells you is that those stabbings were almost always a reaction to the IDF coming into Gaza or a Palestinian city and randomly killing 10-20 Palestinians. Palestinians get angry a couple get froggy and the media reports on the reaction but never the preceding action.   That’s because the us media is by and large hugely pro Amish and so they report what the Israeli government tells them. And as we seen with 10/7 the march of the right of return in 2014 or dozens other conflicts the Palestinians protests or actions were not spontaneous. They were almost always reactions to some horrendous actions that the Israelis took against them.   So now in Holland the US media reports that jews are getting beaten in the streets but they aren’t reporting what the jews did to provoke those actions.  What the US media is showing you is that in regards to jewish actions in the west they will now report it and repeat it exactly as their Zionist controllers want it to be reported and in the same way they have reported in Israel for decades.   And as a result you get the focus on the reaction but never the precipitating action that caused it.  Why am I explaining all this?  Because a couple years into the Trump administration (and it wouldn’t have mattered if it was Kamala or Trump who got elected) when us citizens are reported in the media to be being questioned detained and taken to jail for a few days for “anti semitism” the media will report them as “violent extremists harboring anti semitic beliefs” not citizens concerned about a hijacking of their own government and speaking out. And many of you will fall for what the media reports the same as you did in Palestine in Holland right now and for decades here at home.   That’s where we are going.  Don’t believe me?  Just wait and watch.,4058,19,3,0,3

MaryKostakidis,'Surpassing World War II' Figures - Israel Dropped Over 85000 Tonnes of Bombs on Gaza - Palestine Chronicle 'Israel’s military has dropped over 85000 tonnes of bombs on the Gaza Strip since October 2023 exceeding the amount of explosives used in World War II the Environmental Quality Authority has said.' '..the Israeli military employed a range of weapons and munitions most notably white phosphorus which is prohibited under international law by the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.' 'The organization also indicated that damage to water infrastructure has resulted in polluted water leaking into groundwater reservoirs foreshadowing a health and environmental catastrophe that threatens to endanger residents for generations to come.'

MaryKostakidis,101 BBC Journalists Say it is Biased Against Palestine 'More than 230 members of the media industry and personalities including 101 BBC employees accuse the British media outlet of providing favourable coverage of Israel and call on the public broadcaster to “recommit to fairness accuracy and impartiality” in its reporting on the Gaza Strip.'  'Examples provided by staff include “dehumanizing and misleading headlines” including the one given to an article about a six-year-old girl who was shot by the Israeli army in Gaza in January 2024. Speaking about the headline “Hind Rajab 6 found dead in Gaza days after phone calls for help” a signatory of the letter said: “This was not an act of God. The perpetrator Israel should have been on the front page and it should have been clear that she was killed.”'  '“Palestinians are always treated as an unreliable source and we consistently prioritise Israel’s version of events despite the IDF’s well-documented history of lying” says another BBC employee speaking on condition of anonymity.' 'Other concerns raised by staff include coverage omissions such as the failure to livestream the plea of South Africa’s genocide case against Israel to the International Court of Justice on January 11 but the choice to livestream Israel’s defense the next day.'
